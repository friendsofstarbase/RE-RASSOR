# Research and Education – Regolith Advanced Surface Systems Operational Robot or RE-RASSOR Rover 

# RE-RASSOR is a Florida Space Institute (FSI) robotics initiative aimed at reducing the cost and size of NASA’s original RASSOR design. 

# The STARBASE rover program is intended to teach and foster soft and hard skills, ranging from critical thinking skills, troubleshooting, soldering, and electrical/mechanical design. The PCB design and 3D models are provided, with  students encouraged to build upon the base model. 

# The DoD STARBASE CFL’s STEAM Education RASSOR aims to further simplify and decrease the cost of the RE-RASSOR design by reducing the complexity of the 3D printing, assembly, and programming required. The rover’s components were modeled in TinkerCad and 3D-printed using PLA filament, with internal parts replaced with budget-friendly hardware.
